Project Disclaimer

This is just a side project I mess around with for fun and learning. It's not meant to be serious or polished, so don't expect much.

If you find it useful, cool! But it's not actively maintained, and there might be bugs, missing features, or weird stuff.

Use it if you want, but no promises on support or updates.
